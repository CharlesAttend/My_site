# My_site
My old web page was becoming a bit old. I didn't really like the design anymore so I fully retype it in react with new styling.
I also added a blog that display all Markdown file in a directory.

The old website looked like FullPage.js but I code by my self. It still online on https://old.charles.vin/

I'm still hosting the website on my RaspberryPi at home :D

I first really liked the javascript module FullPage.js. So I did the same by my self.
